# DSD_Project_Hamming_code_error_detection_and_correction-<font size="2">Hamming code error detection and correction system is a Digital Systems Design project for detecting a single bit error in 4 data bits using 3 parity bits. It takes a random 4 bit data and calculates parity bits using Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU) and then concatenates the parity bits with the data bits to make a 7 bit data that is transmitted into an error channel. The ALU then checks the parity bits of the transmitted data and detects the error position using XOR operation. Then the error is corrected by flipping the error bit. The project is done using verilog programming in Active-HDL.</font>
